# UNHEducation
A project for graduate school about the state of U.S. education

This project was our first major project in graduate school. It gave us the opportunity to learn about data collection, data curation, and basic analytics. Our topic was to look at the standarized scores of U.S. states, and see how they compared to each other, and to the world. We also focused on a couple of high and low quality states for a deeper dive.
